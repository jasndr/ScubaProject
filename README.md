<h2>Top priority at the moment?:</h2>
<p>For the meeting with our TA we need to have some implemented functionality (not the interface).  So probably something like a calculator that calculates everything for our dive table?</p>

<h2>Upcoming due dates for the project</h2>

<h3>Check-in #1 -DUE SUN, Nov 2-(Meeting @ MON, Oct 27 for us)</h3>
<p>Three page pdf document of:
 <ul>
  <li>Software design of the major functionality (Ex: Boxes & arrows)</li>
  <li>Description of software process. Recommend TDD, short sprints, and code inspection</li>
  <li>Estimated LOC for functionality (<u>NOT the interface</u>)</li>
  <li>Revised estimate of LOC for the <u>interface</u></li>
  <li>At least one paragraph for verification and validation strategy. Since this is a safety critical software you need a convincing test strategy</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Check-in #2 -DUE SUN, Nov 23 (TA meeting tbd)</h3>
<p>This list isnt too important yet at the moment so ill finish it later.</o>
