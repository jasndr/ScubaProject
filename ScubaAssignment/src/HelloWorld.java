	 //some function that rounds up the user's max depth to the next max depth up to 140feet
	 //if(first dive) {
	 //    pGroup = function that finds the pressure group letter based off of rounding the user entered divetime;
	 //}
	 //else {
	 //    newpGroup = FinalValues.tablethatdoesntexistyet[pGroup][dive interval];
